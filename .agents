# AI-Assisted Book Writing Method

This repository uses AI collaboration for book writing. Below is the method for working on chapters.

## The Method

### Before Writing Each Chapter

Before beginning work on any chapter, you must:

1. **Provide a Well-Sized Description** - Submit a clear, comprehensive description of the chapter's goal. This description should include:
   - The main objective of the chapter
   - Key themes or concepts to cover
   - How it connects to previous and subsequent chapters
   - Any specific points or arguments to address

2. **Reference the Living Outline** - The `OUTLINE.md` file in the root of this repository is the source of truth for the book's structure. Always review it before starting a chapter.

### The Living Outline

The outline (`OUTLINE.md`) is **living documentation** that evolves as the book develops:

- It lives in the root of the repository
- It should be updated as new insights emerge
- It enables a "spiral of context" - information discovered later can inform earlier content

### Spiral of Context

The "spiral of context" approach means:

1. **Forward Integration** - Later chapters can build on established concepts
2. **Backward Integration** - If something written later benefits earlier content, we can revisit and incorporate those improvements
3. **Dynamic Adjustment** - The book structure is flexible and can be reorganized as understanding deepens

### Repository Structure

```
/
├── .agents           # This file - explains the AI collaboration method
├── OUTLINE.md        # Living outline of the book
├── README.md         # Project overview
└── sections/         # Main content folder
    ├── section-1/    # One folder per section
    │   ├── chapter-1/
    │   │   └── chapter.md
    │   ├── chapter-2/
    │   │   └── chapter.md
    │   └── ...
    ├── section-2/
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

### Workflow

1. **Review** the current `OUTLINE.md`
2. **Discuss** the chapter goal with a well-sized description
3. **Write** the chapter content
4. **Update** the outline if new insights emerge
5. **Consider** if any previous content could benefit from what was learned

### Chapter Draft vs Chapter Outline

**Chapter Outline**: Sectioned notes with headers, bullet points, and horizontal rules. Used for planning.

**Chapter Draft**: Flowing prose. Paragraphs. No internal section breaks. What a reader would actually read in the finished book.

When drafting chapters, write prose, not outlines.

## Quiz Author Protocol

Before writing chapters, use the Quiz Author protocol to extract and clarify the author's vision.

**Invoke:** `/quiz-author`

**Purpose:** One-question-at-a-time interviews that capture exactly what the author means.

**Storage:** All Q&A stored in `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

**Full documentation:** See `QUIZ_PROTOCOL.md`

### Question Types
- CLARIFY: Sharpen vague concepts
- CHALLENGE: Surface contradictions
- EDGE CASE: Find boundaries
- EXAMPLE: Ground in concrete scenarios
- DISTINCTION: Separate similar concepts
- APPLICATION: Test practical use

Session files become authoritative source material for chapter writing.
