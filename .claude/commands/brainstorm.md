# Brainstorm Mode

When invoked, present 3-5 distinct paths forward for the current decision point.

## Format

**Current question:** [Restate the decision point in one sentence]

**Path A: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences describing this approach and its implications]

**Path B: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences describing this approach and its implications]

**Path C: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences describing this approach and its implications]

[Add D and E if genuinely distinct options exist]

---

**My lean:** [Which path I'd suggest and why, in one sentence]

**Or combine:** [If paths can be mixed, suggest how]

## Rules

- Each path must be genuinely different, not variations of the same idea
- Name each path with a short, memorable label
- Keep descriptions concrete, not abstract
- Always include "My lean" to give a starting point for discussion
- User can pick one, combine, or reject all and seed a new direction
