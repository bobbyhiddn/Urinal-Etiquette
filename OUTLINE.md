# Urinal Etiquette - Book Outline

> *A book about the ethics of the best choice.*

This is a **living outline** that evolves as the book develops. It serves as the source of truth for the book's structure and allows for dynamic adjustment based on new insights.

---

## Overview

A methodology book disguised as a bathroom joke. The urinal is the entry point because every man has stood at one and made the calculation without being taught. By the end of the book, the urinal fades and the geometry remains. The reader has been trained to see walls everywhere.

**Core Thesis:** Every room has a geometry no one explained to you. This book gives you tools to see it, read it, and position within it.

**The Three Cartographers:**
- Greene drew the cliffs (power, danger, the game as the ruthless play it)
- Carnegie drew the roads (connection, warmth, the game as the connected play it)
- Solomon tells you why the terrain is shaped that way (how the game was designed to be played)

---

## Part I: Seeing the Room

*Before you can position, you must perceive.*

### Chapter 1: The Geometry Exists
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Establish that every room has invisible architecture. Positions of power and vulnerability. Sightlines and blind spots. The urinal as the room where the rules are most obvious and least discussed.
- Tools: The geometry is real; most people don't see it.

### Chapter 2: Most People Aren't Playing
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: The tragedy isn't malice, it's absence. The man at the middle urinal isn't your enemy. He's just not awake. While he stands absent, you can choose.
- Tools: Recognition that frozen people don't compete.

### Chapter 3: The Diagnostic Method
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: The room reveals itself through small tests. Probe, watch, adjust, probe again. How to read geometry you can't see.
- Tools: Small offerings that test the floor. Watch what bait gets taken.

## Part II: The Tools

*Principles for positioning and communication.*

### Chapter 4: The Vacuum Principle
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Don't hold yourself from making decisions if no one else will. Vacuums get filled. The question is whether you fill it or watch someone else fill it.
- Tools: The hand of the diligent will rule.

### Chapter 5: Hesitation as Risk
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: The middle stall is what you get when you flinch. Risk-averse is a misunderstanding of where the risk actually lives.
- Tools: The sluggard says there's a lion in the road.

### Chapter 6: Moving First
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: The person who commits first forces everyone else to position relative to a fixed point. First speaker creates the coordinate system.
- Tools: Moving first transforms you from particle to wave.

### Chapter 7: The Soft Tongue
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Force creates resistance. Patience persuades princes. A soft tongue breaks bones.
- Tools: Create space instead of pushing. Let minds change themselves.

### Chapter 8: Proverbs 25 - The Communication Chapter
- [x] Draft complete: [proverbs-25-breakdown.md](./sections/proverbs-25-breakdown.md)
- Goal: Line-by-line breakdown of Solomon's communication strategy. 17 tools for reading rooms and positioning through words.
- Tools: The Information Differential, The Invited Ascent, The Private Arena, The Fitted Word, The Reliable Messenger, Strategic Withdrawal, The Heap of Coals, The Walled Spirit, and more.

---

## Part III: The Games

*Understanding what you're playing.*

### Chapter 9: Finite vs Infinite
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Finite games are played to win. Infinite games are played to keep playing. Most people treat every room like a finite game. The goal isn't to win the hand; the goal is to stay at the table.
- Tools: The players persist.

### Chapter 10: The Chopping Block Ethic
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Be first to put your head on the block. If they swing, it was never meant to be. Vulnerability as diagnostic. The information is worth the wound.
- Tools: Testing whether someone belongs in your infinite game.

### Chapter 11: Information Over Safety
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Silence preserves safety and destroys information. When they swing, you know. When they don't, you know something different.
- Tools: The trade-off most people get wrong.

---

## Part IV: The Ethics

*Constraints on the game.*

### Chapter 12: Wise as Serpents, Innocent as Doves
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Strategic awareness is commanded. Ethical constraints are required. Both, simultaneously. The serpent sees; the dove refuses certain actions.
- Tools: Aware and constrained. Not naive, not ruthless.

### Chapter 13: The Trap of Being Correct
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: You saw the room clearly. You were right. Now what? The insight becomes identity. Recognition defeats purpose. You were right—say nothing.
- Tools: The unannounced win.

### Chapter 14: Finding Your Stall
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: The way that will give you passion and no one else seems to want to go in. Not competing at assigned tasks, but standing where no one else is standing.
- Tools: The vacuum as opportunity.

---

## Part V: The Weight

*What to do when it descends.*

### Chapter 15: The Shiver Is Universal
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: Every man shivers. The realization that you're small, the authorities were pretending, the systems are held together by small people. This is where wisdom begins.
- Tools: Accurate perception of how things are.

### Chapter 16: The Staircase Appears
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: You cave for a night and a day to the shiver. Then the staircase appears. Walk expectantly that the next path will emerge unexpectedly.
- Tools: Pattern recognition. The reversed list.

### Chapter 17: Positioning and Providence
- [ ] Not yet written
- Goal: You position. Providence resolves. Both are true. Act as if everything depends on your positioning. Trust as if everything depends on providence.
- Tools: The tension that makes wisdom possible.

## Notes

*Insights and connections discovered during writing.*

- Solomon as middle ground between Greene and Carnegie needs to thread through all chapters, not just Ch. 8
- The urinal metaphor should fade after Part I—geometry language takes over
- Fables from Dump.md can illustrate principles but shouldn't become the focus

- [Dump.md](./Dump.md) - Raw extracted lessons, fable seeds, images, and structural notes

## Revision History

| Date | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| *Initial* | Created outline structure | Project setup |
| 2025-12-14 | Restructured around methodology | Shift from memoir to tools |

> **Remember**: This is a methodology book, not a memoir. The reader should see themselves making decisions, not the author. The fables ground the principles; the principles are the point.
