# Urinal-Etiquette

A book about the ethics of the best choice.

## About

This is an AI-assisted book project that explores decision-making ethics through the metaphor of everyday choices. The project uses a collaborative writing approach with AI assistance.

## Structure

- **[OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md)** - The living outline of the book (source of truth)
- **[.agents](./.agents)** - The AI collaboration methodology
- **sections/** - Book content organized by section and chapter

## Getting Started

Before contributing to any chapter:

1. Review the current [OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md)
2. Read the methodology in [.agents](./.agents)
3. Provide a well-sized description of the chapter goal before writing

## The Method

This project uses a "spiral of context" approach where:
- The outline evolves as the book develops
- Later insights can improve earlier content
- Structure is dynamic and adapts to new understanding

See [.agents](./.agents) for the complete methodology.
