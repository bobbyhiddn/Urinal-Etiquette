# Prelude: The Geometry Exists

There are forces beyond your control. There are forces within your control. There are players in a game that is played through the use of these forces.

There are those who choose not to play, both to their advantage and disadvantage, depending on the player. But the game exists. Some are unaware, to their advantage and disadvantage, depending on who's playing them. You must be aware to play. When you choose when to merge, you must be aware. When you choose what to eat, you must be aware. When you choose whether to speak or stay silent, you must be aware.

Empires have risen and fallen on positioning. A general who holds the high ground forces his enemy to climb toward death. A king who controls the river controls the trade. A nation that secures the strait secures the century. The forces were there before the generals arrived. The geometry existed. They read it or they didn't. You've never commanded armies. But you've felt the ripples. Markets move, and your savings move with them. Elections turn, and your options expand or contract. Wars ignite continents away, and the price of your morning coffee shifts. You are downstream of forces you didn't set in motion, positioned by geometries you didn't draw.

The boardroom has a geometry no one explained to you. There are seats that face the door and seats that face away from it, and the people in those seats are having different experiences of the same meeting. There's a distance from the decision-maker that communicates access, and a distance that communicates irrelevance. The person controlling the whiteboard controls more than the whiteboard. You calculate here. You know you do. You've chosen where to sit. You've timed when to speak. You've felt the difference between a room that's with you and a room that's watching you. This is conscious calculation, and you do it every time stakes are high.

When you merge onto the highway, you calculate. Gap size, relative speed, the behavior of the driver you're merging in front of. You don't think of it as strategy. You don't diagram it. But the geometry is there, and you read it, and you act on what you read. When you choose what to eat, you calculate. Cost, craving, consequence. The menu is a room with positions, and you select one. When you speak to your spouse after a hard day, you calculate. What can be said, what should wait, what tone will land and what will escalate. You read the room. You position your words. This is semi-conscious now. The calculation happens faster than thought. The geometry is so familiar you've stopped seeing it as geometry.

You walk into a public restroom. There are five urinals, all empty. You've been here before. Not this specific room, but this specific geometry. Five positions. No one else present. You must choose.

No one taught you what to do. No father pulled you aside and explained the algorithm. No manual exists. And yet you know. You know that the middle urinal is wrong. You know that the ends are right. You know that if you take position two or four, you've made a choice that will constrain whoever enters after you. You've always known this. You just never named it.

This is the room where the rules are most obvious and least discussed. The bathroom is the geometry stripped bare. No stakes worth mentioning. No consequences that outlast the flush. And yet every man who walks in calculates. Every man reads the room. Every man positions. If you know the geometry here, in the lowest-stakes room you'll ever enter, you know it everywhere. The boardroom has five urinals. The negotiation has five urinals. The conversation with your father-in-law, the interview for the job, the moment you decide whether to speak or stay silent: they all have urinals. Positions. Constraints. Geometries that exist whether you see them or not. The question is whether you stumble into position or choose it.

This book is about seeing the room. Not so you can win every room. Not so you can dominate, manipulate, or master. But so you can choose. Knowing the best position doesn't mean taking it. It means knowing you're not taking it. It means the difference between strategy and stumbling. Between playing and being played.

The man who takes the middle urinal isn't your enemy. He's not malicious. He's absent. He didn't see the geometry. He walked to the approximate center because centers feel vaguely safe, and now he's standing in the one position that maximizes discomfort for everyone who enters after him. You've worked with this man. You've sat in meetings with him. You've watched him schedule calls at times that make no sense, reply-all when he should reply to one, take up space in conversations without noticing the space exists. He's not playing badly. He's not playing at all. While he stands absent, you can choose.

Every room has a geometry no one explained to you. This book is the explanation you never received. We start in the bathroom because you already know it. By the end, you'll see walls everywhere.
