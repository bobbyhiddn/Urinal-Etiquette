# Prelude: The Geometry Exists

There are forces beyond your control. There are forces within your control. There are players in a game that is played through the use of these forces.

There are those who choose not to play, both to their advantage and disadvantage, depending on the player. But the game exists. Some are unaware, to their advantage and disadvantage, depending on who's playing them. You must be aware to play. When you choose when to merge, you must be aware. When you choose what to eat, you must be aware. When you choose whether to speak or stay silent, you must be aware.

Empires have risen and fallen on positioning. A general who holds the high ground forces his enemy to climb toward death. A king who controls the river controls the trade. A nation that secures the strait secures the century. The forces were there before the generals arrived. The geometry existed. They read it or they didn't. You've never commanded armies. But you've felt the ripples. Markets move, and your savings move with them. Elections turn, and your options expand or contract. Wars ignite continents away, and the price of your morning coffee shifts. You are downstream of forces you didn't set in motion, positioned by geometries you didn't draw.

The boardroom has a geometry no one explained to you. There are seats that face the door and seats that face away from it, and the people in those seats are having different experiences of the same meeting. There's a distance from the decision-maker that communicates access, and a distance that communicates irrelevance. The person controlling the whiteboard controls more than the whiteboard. You calculate here. You know you do. You've chosen where to sit. You've timed when to speak. You've felt the difference between a room that's with you and a room that's watching you. This is conscious calculation, and you do it every time stakes are high.

When you merge onto the highway, you calculate. Gap size, relative speed, the behavior of the driver you're merging in front of. You don't think of it as strategy. You don't diagram it. But the geometry is there, and you read it, and you act on what you read. When you choose what to eat, you calculate. Cost, craving, consequence. The menu is a room with positions, and you select one. When you speak to your spouse after a hard day, you calculate. What can be said, what should wait, what tone will land and what will escalate. You read the room. You position your words. This is semi-conscious now. The calculation happens faster than thought. The geometry is so familiar you've stopped seeing it as geometry.

You walk into a public restroom. There are five urinals, all empty. You've been here before. Not this specific room, but this specific geometry. Five positions. No one else present. You must choose.

No one taught you what to do. No father pulled you aside and explained the algorithm. No manual exists. And yet you know. You know that the middle urinal is wrong. You know that the ends are right. You know that if you take position two or four, you've made a choice that will constrain whoever enters after you. You've always known this. You just never named it.

This is the room where the rules are most obvious and least discussed. The bathroom is the geometry stripped bare. No stakes worth mentioning. No consequences that outlast the flush. And yet every man who walks in calculates. Every man reads the room. Every man positions. If you know the geometry here, in the lowest-stakes room you'll ever enter, you know it everywhere. The boardroom has five urinals. The negotiation has five urinals. The conversation with your father-in-law, the interview for the job, the moment you decide whether to speak or stay silent: they all have urinals. Positions. Constraints. Geometries that exist whether you see them or not. The question is whether you stumble into position or choose it.

This book is about seeing the room. Not so you can win every room. Not so you can dominate, manipulate, or master. But so you can choose. Knowing the best position doesn't mean taking it. It means knowing you're not taking it. It means the difference between strategy and stumbling. Between playing and being played.

The man who takes the middle urinal isn't your enemy. He's not malicious. He's absent. He didn't see the geometry. He walked to the approximate center because centers feel vaguely safe, and now he's standing in the one position that maximizes discomfort for everyone who enters after him. You've worked with this man. You've sat in meetings with him. You've watched him schedule calls at times that make no sense, reply-all when he should reply to one, take up space in conversations without noticing the space exists. He's not playing badly. He's not playing at all. While he stands absent, you can choose.

Every room has a geometry no one explained to you. This book is the explanation you never received. We start in the bathroom because you already know it. By the end, you'll see walls everywhere.

# Part I: Seeing the Room

*Before you can position, you must perceive.*

---


You already know how to play. You've been playing your whole life. The question is whether you've been playing consciously or stumbling through games you didn't know you'd entered.

Every room you walk into has a game running. The restaurant, the meeting, the conversation with your wife after a hard day. There are positions and players and moves being made whether you see them or not. Most people don't see them. They walk through rooms like sleepwalkers, responding to stimuli, reacting to what happens to them instead of choosing what happens next. They're not bad people. They're not even losing, necessarily. They're just absent. And absence has a cost.

The game is open to everyone. There's no membership fee, no secret handshake, no bloodline requirement. The only currency is attention. Pay attention and you can play. Stop paying attention and you'll still be in the game, but the game will be playing you.

I'm not going to teach you anything you don't already know. I'm going to wake you up to what you've been doing unconsciously so you can start doing it on purpose. You've calculated before. You've positioned before. You've read a room and chosen where to stand, what to say, when to stay silent. You did it this week. You did it today. The difference between you and the man who never wins is that he does all of this on accident, and you're about to do it with your eyes open.

Think about the last time you walked into a bathroom with five urinals and nobody else there. You didn't stand in the middle. You know you didn't. You took an end. You maximized distance from whoever might come in next. You calculated exposure, minimized risk, chose a position that gave you the best chance of completing your mission without unnecessary contact. You did this without thinking about it. You did this without anyone teaching you. The strategy was obvious, so obvious that you never named it.

Now think about what you were actually doing. You walked into a room, assessed the positions available, considered the players who might enter after you, and selected the position that minimized your exposure while preserving options for everyone else. You ran a risk calculus in your head before your conscious mind even registered the problem. Infil, execute, exfil. Get in, do your business, get out with as little contact as possible. The bathroom is a mission, and you've been running it successfully your entire adult life.

But you have a name for the man who takes the middle urinal. You've seen him. He walks to the approximate center because centers feel vaguely safe, and now he's standing in the one position that forces everyone who enters after him into discomfort. If someone takes position one, there's only one urinal of buffer. If someone takes position five, same problem. The middle urinal man has constrained the entire room by not paying attention. He wasn't malicious. He wasn't playing against you. He wasn't playing at all.

You've worked with this man. You've sat in meetings with him. He schedules calls at times that make no sense for anyone except himself, and he doesn't even benefit because he didn't think about it. He replies all when he should reply to one. He takes up space in conversations without noticing the space exists. He's not your enemy. He's not even a competitor. He's furniture that moves. And you've been him. I've been him. We've all taken the middle urinal in some room, at some moment, because we stopped paying attention and the game kept going without us.

The question is how often. The question is whether you're awake more than you're asleep. The question is whether, when it matters, you can see.

Here's what I want you to understand: the correct position exists. In the bathroom, it's the end. In the meeting, it's the seat that gives you the view you need and the access to the people who matter. In the conversation, it's the timing and the tone that lands your point without triggering defensiveness. The correct position exists, and you can learn to see it. But seeing it requires accepting that there's something to see. Most people resist this. They want rooms to be neutral spaces where everyone's just being themselves. That's a nice idea. It's also a lie they tell themselves so they don't have to pay attention.

The tell is always the same. When someone says "I don't play games" or "I just say what I think," they're announcing their blindness. They're not refusing to play. They're refusing to see. The game continues around them while they congratulate themselves for their authenticity. Meanwhile, they're getting positioned by everyone who bothered to notice the board.

This doesn't mean everyone is scheming against you. Most people aren't thinking about you at all. They're running their own calculations, protecting their own positions, trying to get through their own missions with minimal exposure. The problem isn't malice. The problem is that when everyone is calculating and you're not, you become the variable they calculate around. You become the middle urinal man, constraining rooms you don't even know you're in.

I was at dinner recently. The kitchen was struggling. We waited an hour for food, and when it finally arrived, my mother-in-law's dish had an allergen she couldn't eat. The server had been great all night despite the chaos that wasn't her fault. She came back to the table, apologized, and said she was going to get the manager because she could see the trouble we'd been dealing with.

My mother-in-law started to wave it off. "Don't worry about it," she began to say. I cut her off, gently but firmly. "Thank you," I said to the server. "That would be great."

Watch what just happened. The server created an opening. She saw the geometry of the situation and offered a move that could benefit everyone. The manager would want to know about problems in the kitchen. The restaurant would want a chance to make it right. We deserved acknowledgment for what we'd been through. The server was playing well, creating an opportunity for justice to occur.

My mother-in-law almost closed the opening. Her instinct was to absorb the discomfort, to wave off the offer, to pretend everything was fine when it wasn't. She thought she was being kind. She thought she was making things easier. But easier for whom? The restaurant would lose feedback about their kitchen. The manager would miss a chance to demonstrate care. We would pay full price for a meal that nearly made someone sick. The server would leave the interaction feeling like her good instincts had been wasted.

The manager came. I told her that our server had been excellent, but the experience had been rough. I said I wasn't asking for a full comp, but I needed some kind of justice served. Notice the framing. I wasn't demanding. I wasn't threatening. I was naming what had happened and asking for appropriate acknowledgment. I told her I didn't want to disservice them, I just wanted justice for our disservice. The manager agreed immediately, cut the bill in half, and apologized. We left with a reasonable price, a protected server, and my mother-in-law's health intact.

If I had let the wave-off happen, we would have paid full price for a meal that nearly made someone sick. No justice. Just discomfort absorbed and absorbed until everyone goes home slightly worse off than they should be. My mother-in-law wasn't wrong to want peace. She was wrong about what peace costs.

This is what I mean by the middle urinal. Waving it off feels like harmony. It feels like you're being easy, keeping the peace, not making a scene. But you're not keeping the peace. You're forfeiting your position because you think it helps everyone. It doesn't. The restaurant still had problems that needed to surface. The server still deserved to have her good work noted. The bill still didn't reflect the experience. Waving it off helps no one. It just feels like it does, and that feeling is the trap.

Peace isn't the absence of conflict. Peace is justice. It's making sure the low isn't too low and the high isn't too high. When I told the manager I wanted justice for our disservice, I wasn't being aggressive. I was being accurate. Something went wrong, and the correct response was acknowledgment and correction. Waving it off would have been the aggressive move, aggressive against myself, against my party, against the truth of what happened.

I had to override something to say what I said. There's always discomfort in conviction. The pull to let someone else's game play out, even when it hurts you, is strong. It feels virtuous. It feels generous. But generosity without attention is just surrender dressed up in nice clothes. Real generosity knows what it's giving. Unconscious surrender just loses and calls it kindness.

The override is the moment that matters. You feel the pull to yield, to take the middle urinal, to wave off the manager. You feel the social pressure to smooth things over, to not be difficult, to go along. And then you choose. You choose to hold your position because you know why you're holding it. You choose discomfort over surrender. That choice, repeated across thousands of small moments, is what separates the conscious player from everyone else.

So here are the players in every room. Learn them, because you'll see them everywhere once you know what to look for.

The absent player doesn't know a game is happening. He takes the middle urinal. He waves off the manager. He sits in the seat that blocks his own view and constrains everyone else. He's not playing badly because he's not playing at all. His decisions are reactions to the immediate moment with no awareness of position, no calculation of exposure, no sense that other players exist. He thinks the room is neutral. He thinks everyone's just being themselves. He pays the cost of his absence and calls it normal.

You can spot the absent player by his confusion when things don't go his way. He didn't see the meeting get decided before the meeting started. He didn't notice that the project was assigned based on positioning that happened in the hallway. He keeps showing up thinking the room is neutral, and he keeps being surprised when it turns out someone else already calculated.

The misguided peacekeeper knows something is happening but believes the right move is always to yield. She waves off every offer of justice. She apologizes when she's been wronged. She thinks surrender is kindness and calls it keeping the peace. But the peace she keeps is false. It's the absence of expressed conflict, not the presence of justice. She's paying for other people's mistakes and calling it generosity. She's the middle urinal man with a philosophy.

The misguided peacekeeper is more dangerous than the absent player because she has reasons for her blindness. She'll defend the wave-off as virtue. She'll call you aggressive for holding position. She'll make you feel like the problem for noticing the game exists. Her philosophy protects her from seeing what yielding actually costs, and she'll try to extend that protection to you whether you want it or not.

The conscious player sees the room. He knows there are positions and players and moves. He calculates exposure. He weighs options. He understands that every choice constrains future choices, his own and others'. He doesn't always take the optimal position. Sometimes he yields on purpose, for reasons he can name. But when he yields, he knows he's yielding. When he holds, he knows he's holding. He's not stumbling through the game. He's playing it.

The conscious player loses sometimes. This is important to understand. Seeing the game doesn't mean winning every exchange. It means knowing when you've lost and why. It means making trades you can name for reasons you believe in. The conscious player who yields a position to preserve a relationship has made a decision. The absent player who yields the same position because he didn't notice it existed has made nothing. He's just been moved.

I'm not here to make you ruthless. I'm here to make you awake. The conscious player isn't the one who dominates every room. He's the one who sees every room. What he does with that sight is his choice. Sometimes the correct move is to take the end urinal. Sometimes it's to give someone else the better position because you can afford to and they can't. The point isn't winning every exchange. The point is knowing there's an exchange happening.

You've felt the difference. You've been in rooms where you were asleep and rooms where you were awake. The awake version of you noticed where the decision-maker was sitting. He noticed who controlled the whiteboard, who spoke first, who stayed silent and why. He noticed the moment when the conversation shifted and positioned his contribution to land after the shift, not before. He wasn't manipulating. He was playing. There's a difference, and the difference is attention.

The awake version of you is who you want to be more often. Not always. Sleep has its place. Not every room deserves your full calculation. But when it matters, when the room is one where positions get set and futures get determined, you want to be awake. You want to see the board. You want to know, when you take a position, that you took it.

So how do you start seeing? You start by accepting that there's something to see. That's the first barrier, and for many people it's the only one they never clear. They refuse the premise. They insist rooms are neutral, people are just being themselves, and anyone who thinks otherwise is paranoid or manipulative. Let them believe it. Their blindness is not your problem. Your problem is your own sight.

Once you accept the game exists, you start noticing entry points. Every room has a moment when positions get established. In a meeting, it's the first few minutes: who sits where, who speaks first, who sets the agenda before the agenda gets formally set. In a conversation, it's the opening frame: who defines what the conversation is about, who establishes the emotional register, who creates the space that everyone else will fill. The entry point is where the game gets shaped, and most people miss it entirely because they're still settling in while the positions are being claimed.

Watch for offers. The server offering to get the manager was an offer. A colleague suggesting you lead a project is an offer. Your spouse asking if you want to talk about something is an offer. Offers are openings in the game, moments when someone creates space for a move. Most offers get waved off by people who don't recognize them as moves. They think the offer is just conversation, just politeness, just checking in. But every offer is a position being made available. The question is whether you see it and whether you want it.

Watch for constraints. Every choice you make constrains your future choices and other people's options. The middle urinal constrains everyone who enters after. The meeting seat you choose constrains your access and visibility. The frame you accept for a conversation constrains what can be said within it. When you see constraints, you see the shape of the game. You see why certain outcomes became inevitable while others became impossible. Most people only see constraints after they've been boxed in. The conscious player sees them as they form.

Watch yourself. This is the hardest part. Notice when you feel the pull to yield. Notice when you're about to wave something off. Notice when you're choosing the middle urinal because it feels safe rather than because it's correct. Your instincts will lie to you. They'll dress up surrender as kindness and blindness as virtue. The only way to override them is to catch them in the act, to see the pull as a pull rather than as the obvious right move. This takes practice. It takes failing and noticing that you failed. It takes being the middle urinal man and recognizing yourself in the moment, or shortly after, and choosing differently next time.

The game is not optional. You're in it whether you signed up or not. The only question is whether you're playing or being played. The absent player gets played by everyone, including himself. The misguided peacekeeper gets played by anyone willing to let her yield. The conscious player might still lose, but at least he loses on purpose, making trades he can name for reasons he believes in.

I'm writing this for my son, for when he's old enough to need it. But he's not old enough yet, so I'm writing it for you. You asked me how to grow. This is how. Wake up to the room. See the positions. Notice who's playing and who's absent. Calculate the cost of your choices before you make them. And when you feel the pull to wave it off, to take the middle urinal, to surrender your position for a peace that isn't peace, override it. The discomfort you feel is the price of consciousness. It's cheaper than the price of sleep.

The bathroom was never about bathrooms. You knew that. The urinal was just the room where you first noticed what you'd been doing all along. Now you have a name for it. Now you can see it everywhere. The game is open. The currency is attention. Pay it, and play.
