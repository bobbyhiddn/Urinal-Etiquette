# Chapter 1: Urinal Strategy

> **Status**: Not yet written
> **Part**: I - Seeing the Room

## Chapter Goal

Now that the Prelude has established that geometry exists and the reader already knows it unconsciously, this chapter dives into the actual strategy. What IS the correct urinal choice? Why? What does it teach about positioning in general?

## Notes

- This is the first "teaching" chapter after the Prelude's setup
- Should explain the actual algorithm/logic of urinal selection
- Then expand to: what does this pattern teach us about all rooms?
