# Session: Book Opening

**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Topic:** How to start the book (Chapter 1 structure)

---

## Q: Does the book start in the bathroom, or does it start in a room and walk the reader into the bathroom?

**A:** It should start with a zoomed out pontification on game theory that continues to zoom in further and further until the user is stood in front of an empty row of urinals and must make the most apt decision possible. And does it matter if they make the best decision at all?

**Captured insight:** Zoom structure: Game theory (abstract) → progressively narrower → urinal (concrete). Ends with the question: does the "best" choice even matter?

**Status:** Resolved
