# Session: Book Opening

**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Topic:** How to start the book (Chapter 1 structure)

---

## Q: Does the book start in the bathroom, or does it start in a room and walk the reader into the bathroom?

**A:** It should start with a zoomed out pontification on game theory that continues to zoom in further and further until the user is stood in front of an empty row of urinals and must make the most apt decision possible. And does it matter if they make the best decision at all?

**Captured insight:** Zoom structure: Game theory (abstract) → progressively narrower → urinal (concrete). Ends with the question: does the "best" choice even matter?

**Status:** Resolved

## Q: The ending question - "does it matter if they make the best decision at all?" - seems to undercut the premise. What's the actual answer?

**A:** Yes. The best answer must be known. Then you can choose to take a less than perfect choice for any motive of your choice. Want to leave the best spot for others? Sure. Want to take it for yourself? Go ahead. But don't stumble into the ideal or unideal. Making the best choice is the path of the player. Everyone else makes their choices based on the choice you make.

**Captured insight:** Know the optimal, then choose freely. The sin isn't taking a suboptimal position - it's not knowing you're doing it. Players know the geometry; non-players stumble. Your choice becomes others' constraint.

**Status:** Resolved - Core thesis clarified
