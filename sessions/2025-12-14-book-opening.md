# Session: Book Opening

**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Topic:** How to start the book (Chapter 1 structure)

---

## Q: Does the book start in the bathroom, or does it start in a room and walk the reader into the bathroom?

**A:** It should start with a zoomed out pontification on game theory that continues to zoom in further and further until the user is stood in front of an empty row of urinals and must make the most apt decision possible. And does it matter if they make the best decision at all?

**Captured insight:** Zoom structure: Game theory (abstract) → progressively narrower → urinal (concrete). Ends with the question: does the "best" choice even matter?

**Status:** Resolved

## Q: The ending question - "does it matter if they make the best decision at all?" - seems to undercut the premise. What's the actual answer?

**A:** Yes. The best answer must be known. Then you can choose to take a less than perfect choice for any motive of your choice. Want to leave the best spot for others? Sure. Want to take it for yourself? Go ahead. But don't stumble into the ideal or unideal. Making the best choice is the path of the player. Everyone else makes their choices based on the choice you make.

**Captured insight:** Know the optimal, then choose freely. The sin isn't taking a suboptimal position - it's not knowing you're doing it. Players know the geometry; non-players stumble. Your choice becomes others' constraint.

**Status:** Resolved - Core thesis clarified

## Q: Where does generosity fit in the framework? Is choosing suboptimally for others a feature or an exception?

**A:** Generosity is a feature of the system and opens doors that self-oriented choices don't have. Generosity is gambling with good positioning. I could take advantage of every opportunity, but that would lock me out of opportunities that others have access to and I never will. Leaving the door open to generosity is saying "The choices I have at my disposal may not be the ideal in the long term." If you let others flourish, you may encourage them to take you along. But accept that generosity is seen by God, and He rewards.

**Captured insight:** Generosity is strategic, not anti-strategic. It's a gamble that your visible options aren't your best long-term options. Pure self-interest locks doors. Letting others flourish may get you invited through doors you couldn't open alone. And: God sees and rewards.

**Status:** Resolved - Connects to infinite games (Part III) and Providence (Part V)

## Q: How explicitly Christian does the book need to be? Does the framework work for secular readers on strategy alone, or is providence load-bearing?

**A:** My answer could be considered a two-facet answer, where both are correct. I think we can build it so that it could be read as general wisdom, but I want to be explicit that this is a Christian's book, maybe not a Christian book.

**Captured insight:** Two-layer structure. Layer 1: General wisdom that works on strategy alone (generosity as long-game, doors opened by letting others flourish). Layer 2: The author's worldview is explicit - this is a Christian writing, not hiding it, but not requiring the reader to share it. "A Christian's book, not a Christian book."

**Status:** Resolved - Key framing for tone and audience

---

## Q: Does the Christian layer intensify as the book progresses, or is it evenly distributed?

**A:** I think we can evenly distribute. We just speak from my worldview, we're not trying to sell it. This is a lens in the form of a book.

**Captured insight:** Consistent worldview throughout, not a crescendo toward faith. Solomon in Part II is treated the same as providence in Part V. The author speaks from his perspective naturally - not arguing for it, not hiding it. A lens, not a sermon.

**Status:** Resolved - Tone guidance for all chapters
