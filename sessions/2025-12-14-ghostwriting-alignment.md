# Session: Ghostwriting Alignment

**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Topic:** Understanding the author's voice, purpose, and what ghostwriting means for this project

---

## Q: What does ghostwriting mean for this project? You speak and I polish? I draft and you approve? Co-creation?

**A:** I envision our ghostwriting function to be force multiplication. I provide the seed, you procedurally generate large amounts of content from that seed in an emulation of my voice. So if I provide a paragraph of input, you should be able to extrapolate to about a 6 paragraph section. I understand there will be entropy and diminishing returns if I provide you a paragraph and expect you to output a book, and it will be misaligned to my voice, vision, and purposes.

**Captured insight:** Force multiplication model. Ratio: 1 paragraph seed → ~6 paragraphs output. Author provides seeds; AI extrapolates in author's voice. Entropy increases with distance from seed. More seed = more alignment. This isn't "AI writes book" - it's "author's seeds, amplified."

**Status:** Resolved - Core ghostwriting model established

## Q: What makes writing sound like you? What markers should I hit or avoid?

**A:** I'll let you determine that from my writing and my responses. [Author provided examples/Intuition_Engine.md as voice sample]

**Claude's analysis of voice markers from Intuition_Engine.md:**

**Structure:**
- Long-form, deeply organized with clear headers
- Thesis stated early and explicitly ("Here's my thesis: AI does not deduce; it proposes.")
- Pattern: Statement → Explanation → Example → Implication → Return to thesis

**Sentence rhythm:**
- Mixes short declarative punches with longer explanatory sentences
- "This isn't a flaw in our tools - it's a mathematical impossibility."
- Parallel construction: "Not mystical consciousness, not human replacement, but practical systems..."

**Tone:**
- Technical but accessible - terms explained on first use, never dumbed down
- Dry humor arrives unexpectedly ("Thanks, ChatGPT, I never would have thought of that.")
- Self-aware commentary ("Yes, I'm getting meta about being meta. Deal with it.")
- Confident without being preachy

**Rhetorical moves:**
- Grounds abstraction in concrete examples immediately
- Uses extended metaphors that carry through (bowling lanes/bumpers)
- References sources naturally, woven in rather than proof-texted
- Direct address to reader when teaching ("You walk into...")
- First-person when sharing opinion ("I've put a lot of thought into it")

**What to avoid:**
- Generic platitudes
- Hedging language ("perhaps," "maybe," "it could be argued")
- Over-explaining the obvious
- Losing the thread - always returns to core thesis
- **"Not X, it's Y" constructions** - author correction
- **Em-dashes (—)** - absolutely zero

**Status:** Resolved - Voice markers captured from sample

---

## Q: Does the voice stay the same across genres? Intuition Engine is technical; Urinal Strategy is wisdom literature.

**A:** Avoid "Not X, it's Y" constructions. Absolutely zero em-dashes.

**Captured insight:** Specific style constraints that apply regardless of genre. The "Not X, it's Y" pattern appears frequently in Intuition Engine but should be avoided in Urinal Strategy. Em-dashes are banned entirely.

**Status:** Resolved - Style constraints added

---

## Q: What replaces technical scaffolding in wisdom literature? What carries the weight when there's no code?

**A:** Visual diagrams and flows to illustrate methods. Mix of extended and punchy chapters. Punchy chapters when building into a new section. If you need a scenario, ask for one instead of making it up.

**Captured insight:**
- **Diagrams/flows**: Visual aids to ground abstract concepts (replaces code blocks)
- **Chapter rhythm**: Extended chapters for depth, punchy chapters for transitions into new sections
- **Scenarios**: Ask, don't invent. This maintains the force multiplication model. Author provides seed scenarios; AI amplifies. No AI-invented examples.

**Status:** Resolved - Structure and scaffolding guidance
