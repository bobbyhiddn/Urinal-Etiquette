# Session: Ghostwriting Alignment

**Topic:** Understanding the author's voice, purpose, and what ghostwriting means for this project

## Q: What does ghostwriting mean for this project? You speak and I polish? I draft and you approve? Co-creation?

**A:** I envision our ghostwriting function to be force multiplication. I provide the seed, you procedurally generate large amounts of content from that seed in an emulation of my voice. So if I provide a paragraph of input, you should be able to extrapolate to about a 6 paragraph section. I understand there will be entropy and diminishing returns if I provide you a paragraph and expect you to output a book, and it will be misaligned to my voice, vision, and purposes.

**Captured insight:** Force multiplication model. Ratio: 1 paragraph seed → ~6 paragraphs output. Author provides seeds; AI extrapolates in author's voice. Entropy increases with distance from seed. More seed = more alignment. This isn't "AI writes book" - it's "author's seeds, amplified."

**Status:** Resolved - Core ghostwriting model established
