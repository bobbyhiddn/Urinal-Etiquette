# Session: Chapter 1 - Urinal Strategy

**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Topic:** Seeds for Chapter 1 drafting (target: 10 Q&A before draft)

## Q1: What IS the correct urinal choice? Walk me through the logic.

**A:** The correct choice exists, but it is based on an intense risk calculus. It should take all positions and players into account. Height is a definite factor, and the primary variable is exposure.

**Captured insight:**
- Correct choice exists (not subjective)
- Risk calculus drives the decision
- Must account for: all positions, all players
- Height matters
- Primary variable: exposure

**Status:** Partial - need to unpack "exposure" and "height"

## Q2: Exposure - what does minimizing exposure mean in the urinal context? Physical exposure? Social exposure? Both?

**A:** Minimizing exposure is avoiding seeing something only a romantic partner should see, and who actually wants to talk at a urinal with strangers? Exposure is getting in, making as little contact as possible with the other players and exfilling after the job is done.

**Captured insight:**
- Physical exposure: avoid seeing what shouldn't be seen
- Social exposure: no one wants to talk at urinals
- Framing: it's a mission - infil, execute, exfil
- Contact = risk (both visual and verbal)

## Q3: You mentioned height as a factor. How does height affect the calculus?

**A:** It's mainly a joke. It's saying that you need to ensure that you can avoid a disadvantage in angle.

**Captured insight:**
- Height = angle disadvantage (light touch, humor)
- Don't over-drill specifics; focus on extrapolation

## Q4: The urinal room has clear geometry - positions, exposure, minimal contact. When the reader leaves the bathroom chapter, what's the first "real" room you want them to see through this lens?

**A:** [Awaiting response]
