# Session: Chapter 1 - Urinal Strategy

**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Topic:** Seeds for Chapter 1 drafting (target: 10 Q&A before draft)

## Q1: What IS the correct urinal choice? Walk me through the logic.

**A:** The correct choice exists, but it is based on an intense risk calculus. It should take all positions and players into account. Height is a definite factor, and the primary variable is exposure.

**Captured insight:**
- Correct choice exists (not subjective)
- Risk calculus drives the decision
- Must account for: all positions, all players
- Height matters
- Primary variable: exposure

**Status:** Partial - need to unpack "exposure" and "height"

## Q2: Exposure - what does minimizing exposure mean in the urinal context? Physical exposure? Social exposure? Both?

**A:** [Awaiting response]
